# Download and pre-process ROAD++ dataset

Here we provide the **download** and **pre-processing instructions** for the ROAD++ dataset, that is released through ROAD++ challenge: [The Second Workshop & Challenge on Event Detection for Situation Awareness in Autonomous Driving](https://sites.google.com/view/road-plus-plus/home) and uses [3D-RetinaNet](https://github.com/salmank255/ROAD_plus_plus_Baseline) code as a **baseline**, which also contains the evaluation code. 

## Main Features

- Action annotations for human as well as other road agents, e.g. Turning-right, Moving-away etc. 
- Agent type labels, e.g. Pedestrian, Car, Cyclist, Large-Vehicle, Emergency-Vehicle etc.
- Semantic location labels of the location of agent, e.g. in vehicle lane, in right pavement etc.
- 198K frames from 1000 videos annotated, each video is 20 seconds long on an average.
- track/tube id annotated for every bounding box on every frame for every agent in the scene.
- 54K tubes/tracks of individual agents.
- 3.9M bounding  box-level agent  labels.
- 4.3M and 4.2M bounding box-level action and location labels.
